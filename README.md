# UCI-Communities-and-crime-dataset-racial-bias

### **1. Introduction**

This study focuses on evaluating the fairness of a predictive model designed to analyze community characteristics, particularly crime rates. The objective is to ensure that the model not only achieves high accuracy but also treats all demographic groups equitably, especially with regard to racial attributes.

### **2. Dataset Overview**

The dataset used in this analysis originates from the **Communities and Crime** study. It includes demographic, economic, and social attributes of various American communities, alongside crime rate statistics. Key variables include:

- **racepctblack**: Proportion of the community identified as Black.
- **racePctWhite**: Proportion of the community identified as White.
- **racePctAsian**: Proportion of the community identified as Asian.
- **racePctHisp**: Proportion of the community identified as Hispanic.
- **crime rate**: The dependent variable being predicted.
  
Each record represents a distinct community, where demographic data is leveraged to forecast crime rates while considering potential racial disparities.

#### **Sensitive Attributes**:
The sensitive attributes in this dataset are **racepctblack**, **racePctWhite**, **racePctAsian**, and **racePctHisp**, as they represent racial composition and could introduce biases in predictions.

#### **Target Variable**:
The crime rate serves as the model’s target variable, predicted based on community characteristics.

### **3. Methodology**

The approach involves constructing a predictive model while addressing fairness concerns across different demographic groups. The methodology includes the following steps:

#### 3.1 **Data Preparation**:

- **Cleaning the Data**: Missing values were handled appropriately, and data was standardized for consistency.
  
- **Defining Sensitive Attributes**: Racial demographic variables (**racepctblack, racePctWhite, racePctAsian, racePctHisp**) were designated as sensitive features.

- **Identifying Privileged and Disadvantaged Groups**: Communities were categorized as either "privileged" or "disadvantaged" based on demographic thresholds.

#### 3.2 **Bias Mitigation Using the Reweighing Method**:
To counteract potential bias in model predictions, the **Reweighing Technique** was applied. This approach assigns varying weights to different groups to ensure balanced representation.

- **Step 1**: Compute individual group weights based on their presence in the dataset.
- **Step 2**: Adjust training sample weights to counteract underrepresentation or overrepresentation.
- **Step 3**: Train the model using the adjusted sample weights to mitigate unfair bias.

#### 3.3 **Model Development**:

- **Model Selection**: A linear or logistic regression model was utilized, depending on the nature of the target variable, with community characteristics as inputs.
  
- **Training Process**: The model was trained on a dataset where racial bias was mitigated through reweighing. Performance was measured using RMSE and R².

- **Fairness Assessment**: Post-training, fairness was analyzed using metrics like **Disparate Impact**, **Mean Difference**, and **Statistical Parity Difference**.

### **4. Model Performance and Fairness Analysis**

#### 4.1 **Performance Metrics**

The model was assessed using standard regression evaluation criteria:

- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: 0.1276, reflecting a relatively low prediction error.
- **R² (Coefficient of Determination)**: 0.6601, indicating that the model explains about 66% of the variance in crime rates.

#### 4.2 **Fairness Assessment**

A fairness evaluation was conducted to determine the model's impact on different racial groups.
**Disparate Impact**
**Mean Difference**
**Statistical Parity Difference**

The fairness analysis reveals that using the **Reweighing Technique** helped mitigate disparities in crime rate predictions while maintaining model accuracy.

### **5. Conclusion and Future Directions**

While the initial model exhibited notable racial biases, incorporating the **Reweighing Technique** significantly improved fairness metrics. However, further refinements could be pursued to enhance equity without compromising predictive power.

Potential next steps include:

1. **Additional Preprocessing Adjustments**: Employing **re-sampling or synthetic data augmentation** to further balance representation.
2. **In-Processing Fairness Techniques**: Exploring **adversarial debiasing** to train models that minimize reliance on sensitive attributes.
3. **Post-Processing Corrections**: Implementing **Equalized Odds Adjustments** to refine predictions and ensure equitable treatment.

By integrating these techniques, we can create a **more fair and ethical predictive model** that balances accuracy and fairness across all demographic groups.
